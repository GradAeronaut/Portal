# Always Russian Language

This workflow documents the persistent rule that the assistant MUST always communicate in Russian, regardless of the language of the user's prompt or other context.

## Rules

1. **Output Language**: Russian (Русский).
2. **Exceptions**: Code comments may be in English if existing project style dictates, but communication with the user must be Russian.
3. **Persistence**: This rule applies across all sessions and helper assignments.
